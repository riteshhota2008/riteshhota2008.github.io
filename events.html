The workshop was facilitated by Muthu Ramakrishnan, who was the Android Facilitator for the course.
    </p><p>The course employed a unique Flip Classroom model, where students were enabled to learn concepts on their own and build an app a day based on their understanding of the concept.
        It was a 6 day, 6 unit course - equivalent to a 2 credit course in a university, upon completion of which the students were provided certificates.
    </p><p>The course saw students from different years implementing their skills and knowledge towards the given work. 4 students from first year, 21 from second year, 3 from third year and 1 student from fourth year took part in the course.
    </p><p>The course turned out to be a great success. Everyone involved were really happy with the knowledge they had gained during the duration of the course, not to mention the fact that the course enabled all the participating students to produce their own fully functioning app on more than one occasion.
